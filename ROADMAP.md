# lighter-filer Roadmap

***This is a living document. It describes priorities as they are perceived
today, and it can evolve over time.***

## Watch
It would be nice if `lighter-filer` could use `fsevents` (where available) and
install it behind the scenes. The behind-the-scenes installer could be its own
package. `lighter-install`?

## Got ideas?
If you have ideas for features that should be in this roadmap, please submit
a pull request.
